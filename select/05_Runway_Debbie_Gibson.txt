You can pay your way
You can slay all day
Up on your yacht in Saint-Tropez
But it don't mean anything
If you ain't got grit
Think you're on a roll
Yea, with all that soul
And smile that Mona Lisa stole
But it don't mean anything
If you don't work it

Don't wait for someday
Go on give em whatcha got
And go til you cannot anymore
Another fun day
Another day above the ground
Another Queen to be crowned
Yea me

I don't mind
If the world comes at me one more time, cuz
My life's a runway
And, I'm the star!
I don't mind
Cause the haters be hatin' from the sideline
And, yea
Your life's a runway
Be all you are!

Be all you are
Be all you are

You can play that part
Yea, with all your heart
Tear it up just to get torn apart
You ain't no Meryl Streep
Cause you didn't go there
You can think you're this
You can think you're that
Strut through the alley like a cat
But, the others got you beat
Cause you didn't strip yourself bare

Don't wait for someday
Go on give em whatcha got
And go til you cannot anymore
Oh it's your one day
And it's all up to you
So show em' how ya do

Come on oh, yeah!
I don't mind
If the world comes at me one more time, cuz
My life's a runway
And I'm the star!

I don't mind
Cause the haters be hatin' from the sideline
And, yea
Your life's a runway
Be all you are
Be all you are

Don't wait for someday
Gotta give em' all you've got
Be everything they're not
Ohhh
Yea, it's your one day
And it's all up to you
So show em' what you do
C'mon!

I don't mind
If the world comes at me one more time, cuz
My life's a runway
And I'm the star
I don't mind
Cause the haters be hatin' from the sideline
And, yea
Your life's a runway
Be all you are!

Be all you are
Your life's a runway
Be all you are
My life's a runway
And I'm the star
