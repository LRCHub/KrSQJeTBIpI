Fly above the hills and valleys
High above the streets and alleys
On a home bound flight I carry
Love enough for one

My emotions overflowing
Anticipation growing
And the moment still not knowing
Seems to weigh a ton

And those scenarios
They spin in my mind
They drift like the clouds
They sail through the night

And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there

And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long?

I see your face in midnight driftings
By my side I hear your heartbeat
Closer still I hold your memory
Precious in my mind

In the life that I? ve been chasing
So much times been wasted
I know I could be tasting
The love I left behind

And those scenarios
They spin in my mind
They drift like the clouds
They sail through the night

And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there

And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long?

And those scenarios
They spin in my mind

And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there

And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long?

And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there

I wander as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong or have I stayed away to long?

All of you'll still be there
I wander as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong or have I stayed away to long?
